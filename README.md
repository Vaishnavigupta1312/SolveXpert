### How To Run?

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This project hasn't been tested with a ```python-dotenv``` file. To use the AI features, you need a Gemini API key. You can create a key with one click in [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey). Replace ```YOUR_API_KEY``` in ```app.py``` with your own API Key.

Ensure you have the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system. Quickly clone the repository and change the working directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vaishnavigupta1312/SolveXpert.git
cd SolveXpert
```

We have to install all the dependencies of the project. Optionally, you can create a Python virtual environment. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python -m venv venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Now we can run the flask server with ```python app.py``` command.
